# E-commerce Website

Developed a Customer-Seller interaction e-commerce website which loads products a MongoDB databse and displays them. 
Users can select to display products in multiple categories and brands. User can also search products and select items
to purchase and  add them to their shopping cart and after successful transaction the confirmation email will be sent to 
the user.

I've Implemented backend part and features like user Authentication, search products by catagory or brands, invoice generation, 
checking order history, sending confirmation email after payment etc.
